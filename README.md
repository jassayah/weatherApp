# weatherApp
This is a quick weather app using Yahoo Weather API

For the sake of the exercice and the time constraint (under 5 hours) I did not have time to address these issues:
1) Deleting a city
2) Unit Test
3) Functional Test
4) More information on the detail page
5) Animations

If I had more time I would defenetly address these issues/features.

I used for this exercise ButterKnife for View Injection and Retrofit for the network laywer.
